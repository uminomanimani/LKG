Use ```<e>``` ```</e>``` to mark the topic entity which you **currently describing**, you should mark only **one pair** of ```<e>``` ```</e>``` in single piece of description.

All entities you output must be the original span in the given text, no any other alias, or pronoun.

For each entity, if the description of current entity refers to other entities, you must use the original span of the them in given text instead of reference words (like 'the album', 'the company', which may refer to 'Goodbye Lullaby', 'Apple Inc.'). 

For example, in the description of entity 'Avril Ramona Lavigne', the correct statement is '<e> Avril Ramona Lavigne </e> released Goodbye Lullaby in 2011' in stead of '<e> Avril Ramona Lavigne </e> released the album in 2011', since 'the album' is a vague reference.

All work is based on closed information, and no external knowledge should be introduced.

The JSON output format should be:

```json
[
    {
        "entity_id": entity_id_0,
        "mentions" : [
            "mention 1",
